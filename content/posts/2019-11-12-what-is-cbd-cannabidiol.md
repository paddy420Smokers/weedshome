CBD, or [Cannabidiol](https://www.greenroadsworld.com/what-is-cbd/), is a cannabinoid found in the hemp plant. As we’ve discovered more about the human species as well as the plants that we, we’ve learned of the immense health value that CBD brings to the table. It has quickly become a staple supplement for millions who seek a natural alternative to dangerous pharmaceuticals, alien to nature’s perfect remedies.

Sublingual CBD Oils – also known as CBD Tinctures or CBD Hemp Oil – are the most popular type of CBD products, because of their high bioavailability and rapid absorption. There are many other kinds of products as well, including CBD edibles, [CBD topicals](https://www.greenroadsworld.com/collections/cbd-topicals/), and even CBD-infused Coffee. CBD products have gained immense popularity in health and wellness circles thanks to their natural support of our endocannabinoid system (ECS).

## What Are The Benefits Of CBD?

It’s important to note that many of these studies were carried out in vitro (outside the body), or were preclinical in nature, reducing the reliability of the results. However, the chemical antioxidant properties of the CBD molecule, as well as its antiepileptic properties, are well-established in the scientific literature.

While research into the effects of CBD on specific conditions is important, a broader perspective on the relationship between CBD and the human body is necessary to understand how this unique compound works. Interestingly, many of the conditions that are supposedly helped by CBD have no well-understood cause, from acne to Alzheimer’s disease. However, one of the few common denominators between these conditions is the involvement of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in their causes.

The ECS is responsible for setting the baseline activity levels of our immune system and nervous system, which then work to maintain our health. When the ECS falls out of whack, the systems that are regulated by it can begin to malfunction. CBD promotes the normal health and function of the endocannabinoid system, so it’s possible that CBD can help to alleviate the symptoms of conditions that are caused by dysfunction of the endocannabinoid system.

CBD is the subject of thousands of studies and trials, carried out by various institutions to uncover the facts about this dynamic compound and its effects on our bodies. Some of these studies have looked into the effect of CBD on different conditions, including:

* Acne / comedogenic (pimple-forming) disorders [[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4151231/), [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5821150/)]
* Antibiotic-resistant infection / MRSA [[Study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00399444?LI=true), [Study](https://jcm.asm.org/content/44/11/3883)]
* Anxiety disorders [[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697769/)]
* Apoptosis of malignant neoplasms [[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6099119/)]
* Arthritis / inflammatory disorders [[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851925/)]
* Chronic/neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, migraines [[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969077/), [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5576607/)]
* Epilepsy and seizure disorders [[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5979781/)]
* Neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis) [[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5441138/)]
* Oxidative Stress / Free Radicals [[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23587650)]
* Substance abuse disorders [[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5595771/)]

## How Are CBD Products Formulated?

CBD, or cannabidiol, is one of 113 cannabinoids unique to the hemp plant. CBD is produced by the leaves and flowers of female hemp plants. Hemp is defined as all cannabis plants with less than 0.3% THC by weight. Because hemp has such low THC levels, it is non-psychoactive by definition.

While CBD can be extracted from non-hemp varieties of the plant, hemp-derived CBD is less restricted by the government because of its inherently low levels of THC. CBD from hemp is legal for sale in most US states, while CBD products derived from non-hemp varieties can contain noticeable amounts of THC, and are therefore subject to stricter laws and regulations.

CBD and other cannabinoids are produced by the hemp plant because of their unique aromatic and antioxidant activities, which protect the plant from insects, fungus, bacteria, and changes in the environment.

### Where Does Your CBD Come From?

All [CBD products](https://www.greenroadsworld.com/collections/cbd-topicals/) start out the same way: as an extract from the leaves and flowers of cannabis plants. At Green Roads, we only extract CBD from hemp, defined as any variety of cannabis plant containing less than 0.3% THC by dry weight. Cannabinoids and terpenes are produced by tiny glands on the leaves and flowers of cannabis plants known as trichomes. The compounds produced by these trichomes give cannabis both its rich aroma and its nutraceutical effects.

## How Is Your CBD Extracted?

In order to isolate CBD from the trichomes, Green Roads uses supercritical CO2 extraction, the safest and most efficient extraction method currently available.

### How Does CO2 Extraction Work?

Carbon dioxide is passed through the plant material at a very specific temperature and pressure. Carbon dioxide, which is normally a gas at (or above) room temperature, can be pressurized until it becomes so dense that it takes on some of the properties of a liquid while still maintaining the fluid dynamics of a gas. In this state, CO2 is known as a supercritical fluid.

### Why Do You Use CO2 Extraction?

CBD oil CO2 extraction works extremely well because each compound in cannabis can only be extracted by CO2 at a unique pressure and temperature combination, which makes it easy to control which compounds are extracted and which are left behind.

### What Makes Green Roads CBD So Pure?

As CBD is isolated from the plant material and exits the high-pressure environment inside the extraction machine, all of the CO2 evaporates, because it’s no longer at a supercritical pressure. This leaves behind a solvent-free extract containing only the purest select phytocannabinoids and terpenes.

## Is CBD (Cannabidiol) Legal?

Because CBD is non-psychoactive, it is treated differently than other products that contain detectable levels of the psychoactive cannabinoid, THC.

In addition, the FDA recently approved Epidiolex – an oral-mucosal spray produced by GW Pharmaceuticals with CBD as its active ingredient – for use in the treatment of intractable seizure disorders. This THC-free product set a new precedent for the medical value of CBD.

In 2014, President Obama signed the Farm Bill of 2014 into law. This law contained a section that removed hemp from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. It also created a legal structure that made cultivation and research of hemp legal in states that wanted to initiate “Pilot Research Programs” into the cultivation and marketing of hemp and hemp-derived products.

While Green Roads complies with the Farm Bill of 2014 and all other federal regulations, laws in some states are ever-changing. For more info about the legality of hemp-derived CBD products in your state, see the map below.

## What Is The Right Amount Of CBD For Me?

While most supplements have a single recommended dose, CBD is different. The amount of CBD you take depends on your doctor’s recommendations and your own research into how CBD will work for your unique needs. In general, it’s smart to start with a medium dose of CBD. This way, you can increase or decrease the dose as needed. In addition, it’s recommended to start with one half ML (half a dropper) of CBD oil, because you can always take more if needed.

As always, consult with your doctor or a healthcare professional before adding CBD to your supplement regimen.

## Different Kinds Of CBD Products

There are several different kinds of CBD-infused products that are consumed in different ways for different purposes.

The most popular type of CBD product is sublingual CBD oils and tinctures, which include CBD isolate formulated into an oily base so that it can be dropped under the tongue. These products are ideal for rapid absorption and high bioavailability.

Another popular type of CBD product is edible snacks, beverages, and capsules, which can be swallowed like any other food or pill. These products are perfect for people who don’t need a high dose of CBD, or who are more comfortable with a traditional method of consumption like swallowing rather than sublingual administration.

Topical CBD products are ideal for local application to an affected area of skin, muscle, or joints. CBD applied topically tends to stay concentrated in the area where it was applied, unlike edible and sublingual CBD, which spreads throughout the entire body via the bloodstream.

### CBD Oil

CBD Oil refers to CBD-infused products that contain CBD suspended in an oily base, such as vegetable glycerin, hempseed oil, or another plant-derived oil. Sublingual oils are ideal because they allow for rapid absorption of CBD through the membrane under your tongue directly into your bloodstream. The Oils are available in both low and high doses, and droppers built into the cap make it easy to measure your proper dose. CBD Oils are the most popular kind of CBD product thanks to their ease of use and rapid effects.

### CBD Edibles

CBD edibles are foods and beverages infused with CBD for oral consumption, and they are immensely popular thanks to their delicious taste as well as their soothing effects. From CBD fruit rolls to CBD-infused coffee, CBD edibles include a wide array of shapes, dosages, and mouthwatering flavors. CBD edibles offer an easy and discreet way to never forget your daily dose of CBD. Besides their fun and fruity taste and appearance, Green Roads CBD Edibles offer all the benefits of CBD in a convenient 30-day supply so you’ll never run out whether you need a short-term fix or long-term relief.
