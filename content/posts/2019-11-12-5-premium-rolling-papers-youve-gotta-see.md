![Joint Rolling Papers different brands](https://ucarecdn.com/08c04c9a-40b0-4f38-980f-1ff88593d003/)

When it comes to cannabis, everyone has their own favorite method of consumption. For those who haven’t really dabbled in the arts of 420, the versatile ways to do so may initially be overwhelming.

Edibles can take several hours to take effect, which can also lead to several hours of anxiety, leaving you wondering whether or not you took too little, or too much. Other methods, such as dabbing, requires more work and materials than many are willing to try. Joints, however, require no introduction.

From edibles to bongs and bubblers, there’s nothing quite like an easy pull from a classic joint. With joints, you can control just how high you are looking to get, without the expense of purchasing a glass bubbler or dab rig. Also, before you dive further into this article, check out [Everything For 420](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-edible-gold-leaf-520343) for some of the best rolling papers on the market.

Whether you are rolling a fatty for you and your friends or a smaller joint for a solo session or nightcap, joints are as simple as some mary jane and papers. Using low-quality rolling papers can often result in your joint burning too quickly, or even worse, unevenly.

If you’ve purchased a top-shelf product, certainly what you roll with should be of top quality as well. We’ve selected 5 premium rolling papers that will ensure you get lit in style without sacrificing quality.

## Zig Zag - 2 Pack Papers

When thinking of rolling papers, there is often one brand that comes to mind.

Notoriously recognized by the image of the French soldier on the cover, Zig-Zag rolling papers have long been praised and since they were created in France of 1879. They are named after their innovative packaging design, as the papers overlap and are dispensed once at a time in a Z shape. Hence, Zig-Zag.

These rolling papers are relatively inexpensive and have withstood the test of time. The wildly popular 1 ¼” Zig-Zag papers come in your choice of OG Orange or Kutcorners.  Easy to roll,  the Zig-Zag Papers - 2 Pack includes 32 papers per booklet and will deliver an even, slow-burning hit that will leave you thankful they came in a two pack!
