In recent years, CBD has become one of the fastest growing industries in the United States thanks in part to several studies and research programs proving its multiple medicinal uses. Millions of Americans currently use CBD as a daily supplement to aid them with a wide range of conditions such as pain, insomnia, and anxiety. Due to its increasing popularity and promising market value, a great many CBD brands have begun to enter the marketplace making the selection process that much more difficult for prospective customers.

Even though there are hundreds of CBD brands, there is only a handful that truly deserves your attention. Most CBD brands offer low-quality products manufactured using sub-par practices with the sole purpose of increasing profit margins. Some “CBD” products don’t even contain real CBD! So, how can you tell which CBD brands to trust?

Here are five key quality signs to look for in a top of the line CBD brand:

## Safe & Legal Cultivation Methods

It is crucial to buy from companies that use certified organic hemp cultivated using USDA approved practices. The United States Department of Agriculture regulates hemp cultivation in the United States to ensure [CBD is legal](https://www.greenroadsworld.com/pages/is-cbd-legal/), safe to consume, and contains untraceable amounts of THC, the psychotropic compound in hemp. If you want the most effective CBD products, verify that the company grows their hemp without pesticides, GMOs, or other unnatural substances.

## The Right CBD Extraction Process

It is a well-known fact among CBD industry professionals that the best practice for clean [CBD extraction process](https://www.greenroadsworld.com/pages/green-roads-cbd-processing/) is what is known as supercritical CO2 extraction. However, CO2 extraction is an expensive process which is why many CBD companies use cheaper and less effective alternatives.

So, what makes CO2 extraction so special? In simple English, this CBD extraction process takes carbon dioxide (CO2) to a low temperature under high pressure forcing it into a state midway between a gas and a liquid known as a supercritical state. Supercritical CO2 is ideal for pure CBD extraction as it only extracts selected compounds leaving other unwanted compounds like THC behind.

## Pharmacist Formulated

CBD products like oils, edibles, and beverages contain ingredients other than CBD, so it’s important to buy from companies that rely on the expert knowledge and experience of professional pharmacists who know what is safe and effective and what isn’t.

“Consumers should research to chose CBD companies that practice self-regulated, transparent quality control standards to ensure purity and potency,” says Laura Baldwin-Fuentes, head pharmacist and president of Green Roads, a Florida-based CBD company.

## Third-Party Lab Tests

CBD extracts and all other components of a CBD product should be lab tested throughout the formulation and manufacturing process. Even products that have been formulated with the help of pharmacists should be verified by third-party labs to ensure that nothing slips through the cracks thus guaranteeing maximum potency and purity.

## Transparency

If a CBD brand claims to offer products that are pharmacist formulated and lab tested, look for detailed information on their website. Trustworthy CBD companies should be transparent about their entire process, from extraction to manufacturing. You should also make sure they list all their ingredients on their labels along with recommended serving sizes, directions, and warnings. Some companies even go the extra mile and provide easy-to-access information to each product’s third-party lab results.

### Separating The Best From The Rest

These are the most important quality signs to look for when deciding on a CBD brand, but other factors can help you in the decision process. Check out a brand’s website and social media for content and user comments. Do they provide educational information on CBD? What are real customers saying? Do they have a customer service number you can call? These are all vital questions you should be asking of every CBD company you come across. By making sure a brand meets the highest quality standards, you are more likely to enjoy all the benefits of CBD, ensuring your experience provides you with the best possible results.
