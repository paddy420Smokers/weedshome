Similar to humans, [dogs often develop a number of problems as they age](https://www.petplace.com/article/dogs/pet-care/the-effects-of-aging-on-dogs/), but with the help of a healthy diet, proper supplementation, and regular checkups, it is possible to delay or even reverse some of the adverse effects of aging. Among the necessary pet supplements all dogs can benefit from, CBD or cannabidiol supplements have gained quite a bit of popularity recently, and for good reason. Read on to understand how senior dogs actually benefit from CBD supplements and how they can help your own older dog as well.

## They Help With Mobility

Most senior dogs, especially [those of bigger breeds, suffer severely](https://www.healthypawspetinsurance.com/blog/2015/06/11/large-dog-breeds-common-illnesses) from joint pain due to canine arthritis. As a result of that constant pain, which is aggravated each time they make the smallest of movements, older dogs become less and less active with each passing day. This, in turn, gives rise to a number of associated conditions such as obesity, nervousness, and depression. [Canna Companion](https://cannacompanionusa.com/) is a hemp-derived CBD supplement for pets that has been specifically designed to aid movement in older pets by reducing joint inflammation, so it automatically increases mobility in senior dogs. Consequently, even older dogs are able to lead a more active and happier life when taking CBD supplements on a regular basis.

## Senior Dogs Sleep Better With CBD Supplements

As our pets get older, they find it more and more difficult to sleep during the night due to various ailments such as arthritis and other degenerative conditions that cause restlessness. As explained earlier, CBD supplements bring down inflammation significantly, which can promote better sleep, but that’s not all they do. It has been found that administering the supplement just a few minutes to half an hour before bedtime can actually help dogs to calm down and get a good night’s sleep.

## Strengthened Immunity

Older dogs are more susceptible to colds and just about any other canine disease in general, as compared to their younger selves. A combination of CBD supplement + vitamin supplement (that contains vitamin B-1, B-2, B-6 to A, C, D, and E) can reverse some of the age-induced damage to make senior dogs healthier and fitter. It is believed that the cannabinoids found in CBD supplements are primarily responsible for the immunity boost.

## CBD helps In Maintaining A Healthy CNS

The CNS (central nervous system) in dogs, cats, and most animals in general, begins to deteriorate as they age, which is a natural and universal process, unfortunately. Nonetheless, it is still possible to delay or lessen the impact of age-related CNS damage with the help of right supplementation. The phytocannabinoids found in Canna Companion helps in the maintaining a healthy endocannabinoid system in pets, which naturally keeps the neurological damage to a minimum.

While this should give you a fair idea regarding how CBD supplements can aid your senior dog, choosing the right CBD oil is also quite important. Make sure that your supplement doesn’t contain a high concentration of THC, and also that the product is actually certified by veterinarians for use in pets.
