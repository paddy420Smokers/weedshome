Most of you will know that Snoop Dogg is a passionate cannabis fan. You often hear rumors on the Internet about the amount of blunts he’s supposed to smoke every day. One of his most famous songs (within the Cannabis industry) is “Smoke Weed Everyday”. The Blunt is also a constant companion in most of his other songs. In an interview Snoop gives information about his daily cannabis consumption.

When Snoop Dogg gives an interview, as a cannabis lover you have the need to ask him about his consumption. And this was done! We also believe that Snoop likes to talk about cannabis. Towards the end of the interview Snoop is asked how many blunts he smokes every day? I don’t think anyone here would expect he just smoke one or two blunts a day. However, his statement was almost unbelievable. He says he smokes up to 81 blunts a day. This would make 3-4 blunts per hour. OK! It won’t be the money, Snoop Dogg has enough of that. Nevertheless this amount sounds very utopian, if he doesn’t share with all his homies.

Let us come to the conclusion that this number is definitely too high. But one thing we can say for sure – as long as Snoop Dogg lives, he is the best proof that cannabis is not lethal!
