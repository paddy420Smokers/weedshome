Every stoner dreams of having more kief than they know what to do with. What is it, you ask? Kief refers to the resinous trichomes that separate from dry cannabis flower, or bud. These trichomes are like the hairs of the cannabis plant. They contain the terpenes and the cannabinoids that give the plant its vital flavor and psychoactive effects. These two ingredients give kief that extra kick when you smoke it, while providing a flavorful essence at the very same time. But the use of it is by no means restricted to smoking. For those of you out there looking for new and interesting ways to use your kief, look no further!

## Make Hash

Kief is the primary ingredient used in the production of hash. Now we’ve all heard of hash, but not many people actually realize just what hash is. Hash is little more than kief that has been heated and pressurized, causing the resin glands to rupture and alter the taste, color, and effects of the product. It is the rupturing of these resin glands that gives hash its darker color and more intense aroma. Hash is immensely popular in Europe and, as the cannabis industry takes off in the U.S., this unique cannabis product is starting to catch on here as well. For those of you interested in producing your own hash there are plenty of helpful guides all across the Internet. It’s a relatively simple process that I think every stoner should experience at least once. Get out there and try it for yourself!

## Press It (Pollen)

One of the lesser-known uses for kief requires what’s known as a pollen press. These small cylinders, usually constructed out of metal, are used for pressing it into small, more manageable coins. That’s right. All you have to do is collect some kief, fill your pollen presser and tighten the screws. The device will naturally compress your kief into a weighable coin for added mobility and convenience. These pollen presses generally don’t cost over $10 and they can be a fun and creative way to stash some of your surplus kief. Check one out today!

## THC And/Or CBD Liquid

For those of you interested or invested in vaping, this next tip is for you. You see, with recent developments across the cannabis and e-cigarette industry it is now possible for the average, everyday user to actually produce his or her own [THC/CBD E-liquid juice](https://weedhack.de/thc-liquid-selbst-machen-e-liquid/). And what’s more, it just so happens that you can use kief when you make your e-cig juice. The two key ingredients are vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol, which I’ve been told are both very easy and cheap to acquire online. Beyond that, all it takes is a few household supplies and you’ll be ready to go. After all, what could be better than a custom kief e-cig flavor?

## Make Cannabutter

The chances are that if you’re reading this article, you probably consider yourself somewhat of a serious stoner. If that is the case, then this next tip might not necessarily be the freshest news you’ve ever heard. But just in case there’s a couple aspiring stoners out there reading this, we’ve decided to cover all the bases when it comes to using your kief. And that includes cooking! Cannabutter (butter infused with cannabis) is an incredible substance that can really elevate any type of cooking you might be trying to do. What many people don’t realize is that kief, rather than dry flower, is a substantially better ingredient for making cannabutter. Kief-base cannabutter is known for its nuanced and aromatic flavor that stems from the high terpene content.

Let’s review: [cannabutter made with kief](https://weedshome.com/marijuana-and-cannabis-butter-recipe) is not only more delicious and flavorful, but it’s also an efficient way to save bud! Click here to get our cannabutter recipe!

## Dab Kief!

Every stoner with a little experience under his belt has topped a bowl off with some kief here or there, but not everyone has tried dabbing his or her kief. In fact, I’d feel confident stating that many people don’t even realize that you can dab your kief. The fact of the matter is that as the cannabis industry grows and more products become available for everyday users, things like dabbing kief become less and less popular. Why would someone incinerate their hard-earned kief when they can just go out and buy a strain of the best dabs that mankind has ever known? Well sometimes you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do. And sometimes you have to dab it. If kief-based cannabutter provides a more aromatic edible experience, dabbing kief does something similar. You’ll be able to taste the freshness of the terpenes and the entire flavor profile that kief has to offer.

### Conclusion

We hope that this list has provided at least a couple creative smoking outlets for all the stoners out there to try on their own. We think that there’s nothing better than discovering a new way to use the many parts of the cannabis plant, and that includes the kief. But at the end of the day it’s important to keep one thing in mind. There might be something to be said for dabbing, or cooking, or making e-cig juice with your kief, but there’s not many things better than smoking a bowl simply topped with a little bit of it. We hope this list has served you well and we look forward to seeing you again!
