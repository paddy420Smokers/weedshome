Altaria, the inventor of Marboro, is currently talking to Cannabis producers in Canada. Canada’s Cronos Group has confirmed this discussion.

## Will Marlboro enter the Cannabis industry? Yes, the project is there!

It is engaged in discussions concerning a potential investment by Altria Group Inc. in Cronos Group. No agreement has been reached with respect to any such transaction and there can be no assurance such discussions will lead to an investment or other transaction involving the companies.

Many companies realize that the Cannabis industry can be very profitable. For this reason, companies that used to oppose Cannabis now want to join the industry. Whether or not this is fair is another matter.

A good example here would be “Heineken” or “Corona Beer”, there have been a few reports in the past that they are interested in this industry. We personally think that companies like Marlboro have NOTHING to do in this industry and should rather follow their business.
