To an inexperienced smoker, the thought of toking weed resin might seem odd. Why would you smoke what's essentially leftovers when you could smoke flower instead? Well, life happens. Maybe you're waiting until payday or you just don't have time to make a trip to the dispensary. Whatever the case may be, desperate times call for desperate measures. Toking weed resin is one of those things you might have to do to get by. After all, there are worse things in life you could do.

## What Is Weed Resin?

We describe it as leftovers, and that's basically what it is. As you smoke weed, the flower has its own defense mechanism. Remember, weed is a plant and it would probably rather not be burned alive. So when a nug is broken up and you heat it, it produces this dark substance called resin. It cakes into the inside of whatever you use to smoke with.

Weed resin certainly doesn't look attractive, and that's kind of the point. It's made up of tar, ash, and carbon, and most people have a fair amount of it hanging around inside of their pipe. It does have THC left in it, however not as much as a fresh nug of flower contains.

## Can You Smoke It?

If you're in a pinch and need to get high, what can you do? Many resort to toking weed resin. Simply take a few hits off an empty pipe to try to get the effect. Others heat their pipe a bit and scrape the resin out with a bobby pin to get the most bang for their buck

When you smoke weed resin, you'll find that you don't get nearly as high with just a few puffs. In most cases, you have to smoke a lot of resin to get the same effect you would from flower. Some people use the same pipe to smoke it while others enjoy rolling it into a joint. There are rumors of being able to make a resin tea, but people claim that it also makes you very ill.

## It Is Unhealthy!

Toking weed resin brings the same health concerns as any other type of smoking, and then some. Because it's basically the equivalent of smoking straight tar, your lungs aren't going to be happy. If you're looking for a certain type of high, it's also not a great choice, as weed resin doesn't quite work the same as smoking flower.

Those who may be looking to quit smoking weed for whatever reason might use resin as a way to hold them over through the process. If you don't want to keep buying nugs but still need a bit of a high from time to time, it could be a solution for you. But again, weed resin isn't good for you.

Between the awful smell and taste, the health effects, and the fact that you don't get very high, you're better off looking for your THC fix with another method.
