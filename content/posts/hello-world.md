Smoking marijuana is growing in popularity, and so is the various means of taking the hit. Bong is increasing in popularity, and there are bong brands which promise the best experience when getting high. Interestingly, users are finding bongs to be safer in terms of hygiene and protection from harmful elements of marijuana smoke.

## Basics: What Is A Bong?

One might already be wondering what these bongs are. For starters, a marijuana bong is a water pipe-like container that enhances the weed smoking experience. Often, the device comes in the glass material. However, there are other bongs made of wood, plastic, ceramic, bamboo, and metal, among other materials. It does not matter the material of the device since users get the same experience when using them.

Also, bongs come in different designs, but the Carburetor design is the most popular. This is because the design allows for a hole which passes fresh air into the main pipe. Due to the presence of the hole, the carburetor bong gives one of the strongest hits. Notably, the fresh air that passes through the hole compels the marijuana smoke to crash into the user’s lungs at a rapid pace. Further, this makes inhaling of the smoke easy.

Other bong designs which are popular to both marijuana and tobacco smokers include the Straight-Tube Bong, the Beaker-Shaped Bong, the Round-Base Bong, the Multichamber Bong, Percolator Bong, [Bucket Gravity Bong](https://weedshome.com/gravity-bong-cannabis), Waterfall Gravity Bong, and some other homemade designs.

Despite the differences in design, the working mechanism of each bong is the same. Notably, the device has a water reservoir through which smoke passes before hitting the user’s lungs. The passage through the water expels pollutants and other harmful substances. As a result, the smoke that reaches the lungs is pure and smooth, hence making the hit more intense. The basic elements that make up a bong include a tube, a base, a bowl, and a downstem. The downstem is simply a narrow tube that links the base which holds water to the bowl which contains marijuana.
