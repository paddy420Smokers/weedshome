Today's life is accompanied by the stress of one's daily hustle. Traveling between home and the office as well as long hours tend to have a toll on everyone. It is, therefore, only sensible that one gets time to sit back and relax. While different options are available, the calmest place to sit back and reminisce is always back at home. However, this option didn’t previously provide the luxury of utter relaxation, well, not until the advent of CBD bath bombs.

CBD bath bombs have come to revolutionize the aspect of out-of-home spa treatments. Their creation has allowed people to enjoy the relaxation that comes with spa treatments at the comfort of their homes. In addition to this, the product accrues numerous other sensible perks to users (discussed later). This, therefore, begs the question: what are CBD bath bombs and how can one get them?

CBD bath bombs derive their concept from bath bombs. These are small “bombs” (balls of condensed mixtures which effervesce when mixed with water). While bath bombs merely contain oils, scents, bubbles, and color, CBD bath bombs add one extra additive: Cannabidiol (CBD). This non-psychoactive cannabis constituent allows for the potential benefits of CBD such as its pain relief and anxiolytic properties.

The use of this product has come following research into methods of intake of CBD. It is generally known that CBD can be orally ingested and/or smoked. CBD bath bombs bring to market a new and more sensible method of intake: open pore absorption. The catalyst, in this case, is the heat associated with baths. As such, the CBD can get to the bloodstream through the largest organ (the skin). It, therefore, works much faster than when ingested or inhaled. Moreover, its calming effect can be felt throughout the body for longer.

## Medical Benefits Of CBD Bath Bombs

CBD bath bombs bring to users most of the benefits associated with cannabidiol while adding some of its own. While there are, therefore, numerous medical benefits associated with CBD bath bombs, this section will touch on a few.

First, the product helps in relaxing one’s mood through enabling the production of serotonin. This chemical – dubbed the happy chemical – allows the user to alleviate conditions such as anxiety and depression. Therefore, its production is especially important for people with issues with lack or an imbalance in its production. In line with this, since the intake of the product is done through the skin, it is sensible that the skin muscles and nerves relax. Despite research on this not being conclusive, it is clear that CBD bath bombs ease body tension among users. Currently, research is going into how the CBD receptors communicate with neurons to ensure that this relaxation occurs.

The third benefit is particularly important as it quickly solves one uncomfortable situation for ladies: menstrual cramps and PMS. This is never the best situation, and the discomfort which follows can be particularly abrasive. CBD ensures that the muscle tension associated with cramping is reduced. Consequently, it decreases the pain associated with inflammation thereby alleviating PMS. While doing this, the antioxidants contained in bath bombs ensure that the skin cells produced by the body are healthy at production and throughout growth. Given especially that the CBD is taken in through the skin, it’s only sensible that this organ benefits the most. The bombs further treat problems such as eczema thereby rehabilitating the skin while moisturizing it in the process.

The medical benefits of CBD bath bombs don't stop there. Other benefits such as alleviating flu and other colds, reducing pains and inflammations and helping with mental health remain pivotal, especially to patients.

## Preparation Of Bath Bombs

First, mix all the dry ingredients (1,2,3,4) into one bowl and whisk them until they are evenly mixed. This should, however, not include food coloring.

At the same time, the wet ingredients should be whisked in a different bowl (5,6,7), again, without including food coloring. Once the dry mixture is evenly mixed,

add the dry liquid and stir. It may get fizzy at which point, one will need to slow down. At this point, add the food coloring (8).

Now, the mixture should feel like dry sand when held. Thence, fill the bath bomb molds (9) which this mixture and hold the two halves together for a few seconds before gently removing one side of the molds. Allow that side of the bath bombs to dry for about 20 minutes then remove the other side of the mold. After allowing this second side to dry, sit the bath bomb overnight for it to be completely firm.

Finally, sit in your jacuzzi, add your CBD bath bomb and enjoy the perks that come with this home-made remedy. All this thanks to the healing power of CBD and the benefits of modern invention.
