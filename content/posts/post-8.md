A grinder is one of those tools that brings a variety of benefits to your life. They keep your hands clean and provide you with uniformly sized pieces of herb to smoke. They can be a range of colors and offer designs that allow you to show off some personality. Some grinders also have multiple chambers, one of which is used to collect kief. If you've ever been at a friend's house and seen a coin in the grinder, you may have been a little confused.

Let's review the basic components of the grinder. We'll also see why using a coin in it might be one of the best things you can do. While it may seem weird, you just might thank us later.

## Grinding Basics

Forget about breaking up your bud by hand! A grinder provides a streamlined way to ensure you get a good smoke out of your product. Every time you grind your weed, you'll know that you are in for a treat, as you're allowing for good airflow as you smoke. As you grind, the outer layer of crystals you see coating your nugs pass through to a separate tray. Called kief,Â this potent powder-like substance can be used in edibles or sprinkled in your joints for an extra kick.

Instead of letting kief just go wherever if you use your hands, a grinder with a special kief tray ensures you get the most for your money. It can take some time before you build up enough in the tray to actually use it for something, but once you do, you'll always want to make sure you have some around.

## The Coin In Grinder Technique

Some say it's a myth while others swear by it, but putting a coin in your grinder brings your game to another level. First, make sure you choose one that's an appropriate size in relation to your grinder. Then, sterilize it !

* Soap and warm water
* Rubbing alcohol to make sure it's completely clean

By placing the coin in the tray that collects your herb, you help to break off more trichomes. The weight of the currency also helps to push this extra kief into the collection tray below, helping you to accumulate more faster. Some people recommend freezing your grinder for a handful of minutes before gathering the kief, but there's probably no need.

You can purchase a coin online that's specially designed for grinders, as many of them have fun patterns or artwork. However, any old quarter, nickel, or dime will do just fine. Many see using the coin in grinder technique as a way to show they really know all about marijuana and care about each and every part of their weed. Others just want to look like they know what they're doing.

Are you a fan of putting a coin in your grinder? If so, have you noticed a difference in your kief levels? We would love to hear about your experiences with this somewhat unknown method in the comments below.
