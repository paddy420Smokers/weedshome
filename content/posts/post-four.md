THC Lean is made from cannabis syrup. This concentrated product is a good-tasting, non-addictive alternative to the notorious Purple Drank (the original lean), which arrived via [the Houston Hip Hop scene in the 1990s](https://www.houstonpress.com/music/houston-and-lean-a-hip-hop-tragedy-8790214).

Cannabis syrup can be mixed with just about any type of drink. It can even be used like conventional syrup, poured over pancakes or waffles or added to recipes. It’s a safe and easy way to double your fun.

If you haven’t yet tried THC lean, you don’t know what you’ve been missing. If smoking and vaping aren’t your thing, getting your THC from cannabis syrup could be a sensible alternative.

## Is Cannabis Syrup The New Lean?

Purple Drank is codeine-based, and since codeine is an opioid its addictive qualities are real and significant.

And drug dependency isn’t the only issue. In case you haven’t heard, opioid overdose is now the [leading cause of accidental death in the United States](http://fortune.com/2019/01/14/opioid-overdose-accidental-death/). Codeine isn’t a prodigious killer like fentanyl or heroin, but it’s still nothing to mess with.

When you start using opioids recreationally, it is only a matter of time before the other shoe falls. When it does, you’ll likely fall over the edge of the cliff with it.

Cannabis in liquid form has no such downside. THC Lean can be mixed with any almost any type of drink without compromising the taste. In fact, it can improve the taste, since it comes in a wide variety of fruity flavors. THC Lean also won’t put you at risk for devastating drug dependency, which is a pretty important consideration.

In a sensible world, THC Lean made from cannabis syrup would send Purple Drank into extinction. With THC Lean, you won’t have to control dosages to the exact gram to stay alive and out of rehab.

## THC Syrup Or CBD Syrup?

There are actually two varieties of cannabis syrup to choose from, THC syrup and CBD syrup. What you purchase may not be 100 percent pure, but the ratios will heavily favor one cannabinoid over the other.

THC syrup is psychoactive and preserves the usual mind-altering effects of cannabis. When consumed in a liquefied form, the THC will hit the bloodstream more quickly than usual.

The effects of THC Lean are comparable to edibles, with respect to duration and intensity. But you’ll experience those effects even more rapidly.

Flexibility is a major part of the appeal of THC syrup. You can mix it in a smoothie, in a soft drink, with tea or coffee, or in a simple glass of water. It can enhance any liquid you consume with a meal or when you’re looking to quench your thirst.

In contrast to THC syrup, CBD syrup is non-psychoactive. Consequently, you wouldn’t choose it if you were looking to get high or lighten your mood.

But the fast-acting nature of cannabis syrup makes the CBD version of Lean perfect for people with medical needs. When you need relief quickly, CBD syrup can provide it.

## How is It Made?

THC Lean is created through a two-step process.

Step one is the make the syrup, using the usual ingredients. These might include vegetable glycerin, water, sugar and flavorings if you were making it at home.  Step two is to mix the syrup with a concentrated cannabis extract like shatter or wax, which should completely dissolve in the mixture.

After this, the cannabis-infused syrup will be ready to be added to your favorite food or drink. There really is nothing more to it than that.

You can purchase THC syrup or CBD syrup commercially, where it is legal to do so. If you live elsewhere, you can always whip up a homemade version on your own.

## Health Benefits Of CBD & THC Syrup

There are multiple medical conditions that respond positively to CBD, with or without THC. If you suffer from chronic pain, anxiety disorders, inflammation, depression, gut disorders, skin diseases or autoimmune disorders, for example, mixing some CBD syrup in your drink on a regular basis could deliver immediate benefits.

THC has its own medical benefits of course, which is why it is included in many medicinal cannabis products. In fact, many medical practitioners and cannabis researchers believe a THC/CBD ratio of 1:1 will produce the best therapeutic effects. So if you’ve been diagnosed with challenging medical conditions, it might be wise to include both THC syrup and CBD syrup in your cannabis consumption regimen.

The potential healing capacity of THC Lean is yet another reason why it’s far preferable to the codeine-based version. Drink enough of that stuff and it can put you inthe hospital. Drink enough THC Lean and it may help keep you out.

## Dosage And Safe Use

There is no firm set dosage for cannabis syrup. How much you take will depend on the desired impact. In general, sensible guidelines for edibles should apply equally well for cannabis syrup.

With CBD syrup, your concerns should be minimal. With THC syrup, the best course of action is to start out with the smallest recommended dosage (or less). See how it affects you over the course of an hour or so, and then add more to your drink if you think you need it.

Cannabis syrup is more concentrated than other forms of cannabis. This is important to keep in mind, and it is why you should proceed cautiously when you first try THC Lean.

In comparison to Purple Drank, or other witches’ brews of addictive intoxicants, THC Lean is clearly a safer alternative. Don’t consume it compulsively or recklessly and you’ll be just fine.
