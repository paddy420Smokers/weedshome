If you're feeling rather adventurous and want to try your hand at making your own cannabis-infused products, you may wonder where to start. While you can certainly visit your local dispensary to obtain a range of chocolates, gummies, and hard candies, you may want to branch out a bit. With that sentiment in mind, we're going to talk about cannahoney - or cannabis-infused honey. You can make this delicious substance at home and can use it in nearly any baking recipe.

## First, Some Science

Before we jump right in, it's important to know how to treat raw bud when making infused products at home. You can't simply take a nug, crush it up, and mix it into some honey. Sorry, but it's not that simple. While we won't get too in-depth with the specifics, it's important to take two major factors into consideration.

When making cannabis honey, you have to think about the end result you're looking for. Some strains of weed are skunky and would no doubt result in a honey that's less than tasty. Other strains are sweet and some are floral. Terpenes are the reason that weed has its special flavors. Depending on what you're going for, the strain you choose is crucial.

Now for the science, as marijuana has to be "activated" in a sense when [making edibles like marijuana cookies](https://weedshome.com/marijuana-cookies-best-recipe/) or [Cannabutter at home](https://weedshome.com/marijuana-and-cannabis-butter-recipe/). Those who smoke flower naturally do this through the process of burning their weed, but when it comes to cooking, you have to go through this extra step first.

Called [decarboxylation (THCA to THC)](https://weedshome.com/thc-vs-thca-cannabinoid-profiling/), this process involves baking your nugs at 110Â°C for about 40 minutes. Spread your product on a cookie sheet in one layer and stir it up a few times throughout the process. Now that that's out of the way, it's time to make cannabis honey!

## How To Make Cannabis Honey Aka CannaHoney

This is actually the easiest part of all! Grab your decarboxylated weed and wrap it in cheesecloth. Tie your bundle of joy closed with a string. Using a quart jar, place the bundle at the bottom of the jar and pour any variety of honey you like over the top. You can use local, organic, or the cheapest honey you can find - ultimately it depends on your personal preferences.

If you have a slow cooker at home, awesome, but if not be sure to borrow your mom's. Place your jar in the slow cooker and fill the basin with enough water so that the honey is completely covered. Set it on low and prepare for 8 hours of slow magical cooking to take place.

The slow cooker can naturally build up presser, so every few hours check back on your cannabis honey and open the lid and retighten it just in case. Finally, after you've literally waited all day, pour your honey through a fresh swatch of cheesecloth and you're all set.

How to make cannabis honey isn't terribly complicated once you know the basics, and you can use your finished product for a range of uses. Experiment with different strains to find out what tastes best and enjoy this new way to get high!
