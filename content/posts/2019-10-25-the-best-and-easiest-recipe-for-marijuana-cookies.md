However, if you haven’t tried any edibles and you are up for some new things. Today we bring you the best recipe for marijuana cookies, a simple and delicious way to set a party in the form of cookies. Let’s check it out.

## What Do You Need To Make Marijuana Cookies?

* 130 grams of Cannabutter
* 150 grams of sugar
* 300 grams of self-rising flour
* 1 egg
* Some vanilla drops
* A touch of cinnamon
* A touch of salt

### Preparation Process For The CannaButter

The simplest way to [make Cannabis Butter](http://weedshome.com/cannabutter-recipe) -> You are going to need these ingredients:

* 250 grams of butter
* 20 grams of marijuana
* 500 ml of water
* Heat the water but don’t let it boil, if you boil THC it will lose its properties. Add the marijuana to the NON-BOILING water and stir it for a while, about five minutes.
* Melt the butter at low fire and then add the water. Stir it for about 2 minutes. Remember, it shouldn’t boil.
* Pour the mixture through a strainer in order to remove the stems and leaves, the THC must now be part of the liquid.
* Put it in the fridge for about 6 hours. The oils from butter will absorb the cannabinoids, then you will separate the butter from the water and put it again in the fridge until it solidifies.
* The butter is ready for our marijuana cookies!

## Preparing The Dough

* Once you’ve gathered all the ingredients, melt the canna-butter until it’s pure liquid. DON’T LET IT BOIL
* Put all the ingredients in a bowl and mix them all together until you have an homogenous dough, make sure it doesn’t have any lumps
* Put the dough in the fridge for about an hour. It will give the preparation some extra consistency

## Baking The Marijuana Cookies

* Pour some flour and butter over a tray.
* Spread the dough across the tray and cut it in circles with a knife. You can shape the cookies any way you want. Let’s get a little creative. Each cookie should be half a centimeter wide
* Put the tray in the pre-heated oven (150º) and leave the marijuana cookies there for about 15-20 minutes (depending on how toasted you like them)
* Let them cool and then serve!
